# **Project Portfolio**
### ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
Hi! I'm Imam, an aspiring data analysis or data science professional who seeking to apply my knowledge to real-world experiences. 
Recently graduated from the bootcamp Data Science: Machine Learning Specialization program at Rakamin Academy, in which I got to learn end-to-end data science processes.

This repository is containing a portfolio of data science and data analyst projects that I have completed and showcases my skills and experience in this field. My portfolio includes projects that demonstrate my ability to gather, process, and analyze large data sets, as well as my expertise in creating meaningful insights and visualizations.
Feel free to take a look around and [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/imam-santoso-1865111b4/) if you have any feedback or questions.
