Hi! I'm Imam, an aspiring data analysis or data science professional who seeking to apply my knowledge to real-world experiences. 
Recently graduated from the bootcamp Data Science: Machine Learning Specialization program at Rakamin Academy, in which I got to learn end-to-end data science processes.
